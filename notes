npm init -y [ y stands for yes, set all the values as default]
it will initialize project and create a package.json file.
package.json is configuration for npm 

npm - package manager, will manage package which we will install in the system.
packages are also known as dependencies.
npm manages the dependencies.

The most package is bundler.
what is bundler? 

2 types of dependencies
1- dev dependencies : required in development phase ( -D flag)
2- normal dependencies : can be used in production also 

^2.8.4 [ ^ : caret, accepts minor and patch version update] allowed but not exact 
~2.8.4 [~ : tilde, accepts patch version] - more restrictive 

package and package-lock.json 
package.json is manifest file, maintained by the developers, specifing project dependencies and meta deta 
package-lock.json is automatically generated file that ensures consistency in depency version acroos different env installation.
contains exact version information which gets auto-generatedby npm updated while installing or updating packages. 

package.json is a configuration
node_modules is a like a db - contains actual data / collection of dependencies
transitive depency. When we install parcel from npm, it is dependent on other dependencies which also gets called/installed.


with package and package-lock, we can regenerate node node_modules

npx parcel index.html [ for dev mode]
npx parcel build index.html [Remove main from package.json to resolve conflict] --> production mode 
npx - to execute a package | npm - to install package 


** Using cdn links for react is not a good practice, because we would require to make a call and it will be expensive (costly operation)
it will make network call to unpkg.com and it will get react from unpkg.com 
if we already have react in node modules, it will be faster 
also, we will require to keep updaing the link, if new version is arrived.


React.createElement is an object. ReactDOM converts it to HTML element and render it. 

Function which returns a piece of react element is Functional component. 

Config driven UI - Read 
contriolling UI on basis of data

using keys help browser to understand which component to render [ big performance optimization]
don't use index as keys 

Whenever state variable updates, react triggers a reconcliation cycle (re-renders the component)

# Parcel
